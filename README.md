# Octave - Learn by Practicing

![Octave](img/Octave_Logo.png) is one opensource scientific programming language for numerical computations.

This repository records my learning of [Octave](https://octave.org/#) and shares the practical experience during learning.

The version of Octave used in version 8.3.0.

Here is the [video list in my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6DEHvciXKeUho-j-75rbFs6TBxG7KOPg).

Here is the image export of the learning mindmap (keep updating):
