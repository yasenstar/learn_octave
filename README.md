# Octave - Learn by Practicing

![Octave](img/Octave_Logo.png)

is one opensource scientific programming language for numerical computations.

## About this Repository

This repository records my learning of [Octave](https://octave.org/#) and shares the practical experience during learning.

The repository is regularly synced to Gitee:

Some other similar tools like Octave which are treated also as Matlab's open source alternatives:

- [Julia](http://julialang.org/): a dynamically typed programming language featuring Lisp-style macros, built-in primitives for parallel computing, and functions designed for matrix manipulation, data visualization, and more
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): the main package for scientific compting with Python, which can process N-dimensional arrays, complex matrix transforms, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and can act as gateway for C and C++ integration.
- [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/): another open source option for numerical computing that runs across all the major platforms.
- [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html): another open source mathematics software system that might be a good option for those seeking a MATLAB alternative, it's built on top of a variety of well-known Python-based scientific computing libraries, and its own language is syntactically similar to Python.
